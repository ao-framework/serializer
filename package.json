  "description": "The serializer is a library used to convert an instance of anything to a string and a string to an instance of anything. It does so in such a way as to where all of the pointer references remain intact. It allows for a table of constructors to be presented so that context, on deserialization, could be remembered or changed. Itâ€™s an appropriate tool for cloning instances with deeply nested structures, however be advised serializing state to disk without encrypting and signing is a dangerous practice that should be avoided at all cost.",
