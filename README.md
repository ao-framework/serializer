<b>Serializer</b>
</p>

<p align="center"><em>Currently in early development. Breaking changes will occur frequently.</em></p>

The serializer is a library used to convert an instance of anything to a string and a string to an instance of anything. It does so in such a way as to where all of the pointer references remain intact. It allows for a table of constructors to be presented so that context, on deserialization, could be remembered or changed. Itâ€™s an appropriate tool for cloning instances with deeply nested structures. **However, be advised serializing state to disk without encrypting and signing is a dangerous practice that should be avoided at all cost.**

#### Import the library
```ts
import Serializer from "@ao-framework/serializer"
```
#### Lets say we have a model 
```ts
namespace Model {
  
  export class User {
      public self: User;
      public name: string;
      public email: string;
  }

  export class Note {
      public title: string;
      public content: string;
  }

}
```

#### Set up context
```ts
let serializer = new Serializer(Model, "name-of-context")
```

#### Work with your models
```ts
let user = new User();
user.self = user;
user.name = "Something";
user.email = "Something@gmail.com"
```

#### Serialize
```ts
let userString = serializer.down(user);
```

#### De-serialize
```ts
let newUser = serializer.up(userString);
```

#### Did it work?
```ts
console.log(newUser.self === newUser) //outputs: true
```

### Security Considerations
Serializing state down to a string and reviving it to its original state
without validation raises strong security concerns. Encrypt and sign everything!
